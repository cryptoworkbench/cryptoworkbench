# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
  My project is to create an environment for studying cryptography and the properties of numbers.

# IMPLEMENTED MATHEMATICS (non-exclusive list):
## THE SIEVE OF ERATOSTHENES;
My implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is located at '/actual\_code/project\_code/prime\_table\_generator/prime\_table\_generator'.
Here this ancient algorithm for finding primes is wrapped into a nice, easy to use, _ergonomic_ prime table generator.
This generator generates prime tables in stdout or into an external file. By default it creates external prime tables.

## FERMAT'S FACTORIZATION ALGORITHM
I especially like '/libraries/mathematics/factorization\_engines/fermats\_algorithm.c'
It's a library I wrote for factorizing composite numbers using Fermat's algorithm.

See /actual\_code/example\_code/library\_drivers/fermat\_factorization/ for two front-ends for this factorization engine.
PS. Front-ends can of course be generalized to any factorization engine.
