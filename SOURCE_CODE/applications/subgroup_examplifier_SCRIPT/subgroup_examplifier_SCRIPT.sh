# MAKES SUBGROUP_EXAMPLIFIER INTERACTIVE!
#
# SUPPLY:
# ~ as first argument the modulus
# ~ as second argument the group's identity
# ~ as third argument the refresh rate
#
# A fourth argument can be supplied in order to set the vertical offset throughout loop-time.
# 
# DEVELOPER NOTICE:
# Currently shifts in total the amount of the modulus.
# I'd prefer it if it cycled through at least three times.
