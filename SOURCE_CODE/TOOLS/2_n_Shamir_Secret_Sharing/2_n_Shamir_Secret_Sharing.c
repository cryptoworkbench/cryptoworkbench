/* A first degree polynomial function is obviously of the form:
 * "f(x) = A * X^1 + B * X^0"
 *
 * A.k.a.
 * "f(x) = A * X^1 + B * 1"
 *
 * A.k.a.
 * "f(x) = A * X^1 + B"
 *
 * A.k.a. "A LINEAR EQUATION!"
 *
 * THIS PROGRAM takes the MOD value and the value for A from the command line arguments.
 * Then it determines what linear equation to use based on which number you wished to split/encode.
 * Then it prints out the coordinates of this linear curve over the finite field defined by the MOD value.
 *
 * The user then will choose what two points (which are obviously never "f(0)" (!) ) this proof of concept program should proceed to work with.
 *
 * The program then:
 * #1). Determines 'A' again (verifies* 'A') from these two specified points [* verification by program termination: if 'A' calculated again is not the same, the program terminates; THIS PROOF CONCEPT]
 * #2). Determines "f(0)" using the Mod value and this set of coordinates. This equates to the calculation of the linear equation (first degree polynomial) parameter 'B'
 */

/* Complimentary developers notes:
 * Supplying a point with coordinate x = 0, the general formula still seems to work for 2-n SSSS.
 * I wrote '3_n_Shamir_Secret_Sharing.c' in a similar manner but for 3-n SSSS it seems to be the case that this is not always the case. (and it is if I wrote it properly).
