/* Most efficient prime table lookup primality check mathemematically possible.
 *
 * The greatest number I am guarenteed to be able to inform you of wether is prime or not is the greatest prime in the prime table squared, but this number could obviously never be prime,
 * thus the largest prime that I can affirm for you is prime is the greatest prime that is in the prime table.
 * All numbers in between must be composite or else I would have determined they are composite by their first prime factor in the prime table.
 *
 * You can use the handy dany tool first_prime_greater than to confirm this behaviour.
 *
 * The first step would be to square the greatest prime in your prime lookup table.
