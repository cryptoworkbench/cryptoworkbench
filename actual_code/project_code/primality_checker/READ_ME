Checks for primality with a prime table.

Prime tables can be generated using the program prime_table_generator, which uses the sieve of eratosthenes.

The folder 'tables' contains some elemantary prime tables.

To generate a new table and deposit it in this folder execute '../prime_table_generator <upper sieve limit> ../primality_checker/tables'

The file ./tables/first_9592_primes contains all primes under 1.000.000
The file ./tables/first_78498_primes contains all primes under 10.000.000
The file ./tables/first_664579_primes contains all primes under 100.000.000
The file ./tables/first_5761455_primes contains all primes under 100.000.000
