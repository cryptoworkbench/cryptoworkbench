/* DEVELOPERS DESCRIPTION:
 * The inspiration for this project came to me from the following yt video:
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Q3Mrh03Gk
 *
 * Because of this video, I have decided to implement Shor's algorithm on a classical computer.
 *
 * This to serve me multiple purposes:
 * ### AS AN EXCERCISE
 *      To become a better programmer
 *
 * ### TO ASSERT THIS NOTION IN THE VIDEO THAT SHOR'S ALGORITHM IS NOT EFFICIENT ON A CLASSICAL COMPUTER
 *      To me this is the main purpose
 *
 * This is the first prototype.
 *
 * What I desire is that it will work for any number I put in.
 *
 * Shor factorization cannot be achieved when any of the following two conditions are met:
 * #1. When the period of the chosen number coprime with the composite is not even
 * #2. When this chosen number raised to half it's period (it's period over two) is equivalent to one modulus the composite (watch the video to understand this)
 *
 * Currently, this program is equiped to deal with both cases by automatically going on to the next a when either one of these cases emerges.
 *
 * I know 65 doesn't work.
